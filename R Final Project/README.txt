Project1.rmd is the main r code file that handles all of the injesting of the excel files into R Studio and handles all of the graphing and statistics tests we used in our project. In the R Markdown file in the data manipulaton chunk the code references two excel documents (which are included in the folder), one called "Per_Capita_Income.xlsx" and another file "Crimes_-_2001_to_present.xlsx". In the code they are still pointed at where they were saved in my computer, so before you can run the chunk and injest the data, you much change the directory pointer to wherever you save the files on your computer. The "Crimes_-_2001_to_present.xlsx" file contains the crimes that have occurred in Chicago from 2001-2017. Each crime entry in the table contains much information (much of which we do not use), so the data that we ended up using from this table in the rest of the code is the date each of the crimes occured, the primary type of crimes, if the crime resulted in a arrest, if the crime was domestic, the district the crime happened in, the community area the crime happened in, and the latitude and longitude. The "Per_Capita_Income.xlsx" file contains information about the each of the community areas of Chicago. The data we used from this file in the code was the community area number, the community area name, the per capita income, and the hardship index.
