Project1.rmd is the main r code file that injests of the excel files into R Studio and conducts machine learning, statistical tests and visualization techniques in our project. We use two data files, "Per_Capita_Income.xlsx" and "Crimes_-_2001_to_present.xlsx". The "Crimes_-_2001_to_present.xlsx" file contains data regarding crimes that have occurred in Chicago from 2001-2017. Each crime entry in the table contains the date each of the crimes occured, primary type of crimes, location of crime, etc. The "Per_Capita_Income.xlsx" file contains the average income of each of the community area in Chicago. The data we used from this file in the code was the community area number, the community area name, the per capita income, and the hardship index.
