# Household Income vs. Chicago Crime Rate 

## Context
Big name cities, such as Washington DC and Los Angeles, are known for their rich history, recreational
activities, and even for career opportunities. But if you want to enjoy the rainbow, you have to endure the
storm. While there are numerous reasons as to why large cities are great, they also have a huge crime rate.

## Problem
Chicago is notorious for its high crime rate; it has an average of 5 shootings per day. Plus, there is a 
stereotype that crimes are more prominent in low income neighborhoods.  Consequently, we retrieved the 
respective data and wanted to explore if the average household income is related to the crime in that
area. 

## Analysis
Project1.rmd is the main file that injests of the data files into R Studio and conducts machine learning, 
statistical tests and visualization techniques in our project. We use two data files, "Per-Capita-Income.xlsx" and 
"Crimes_-_2001-to-present.xlsx". The "Crimes_-_2001-to-present.xlsx" file contains data regarding crimes that have 
occurred in Chicago from 2001-2017. Each crime entry in the table contains the date each of the crimes occured, 
primary type of crimes, location of crime, etc. The "Per-Capita-Income.xlsx" file contains the average income of 
each of the community area in Chicago. The data we used from this file in the code was the community area number, 
the community area name, the per capita income, and the hardship index.
